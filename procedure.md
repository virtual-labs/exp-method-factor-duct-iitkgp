## Procedure
- Place the pitot tube at the centre of the duct and connect the total pressure and static pressure ends to an inclined tube manometer to obtain velocity pressure.
- Start the fan.
- Measure the average velocity by traversing the anemometer.
- Find the central velocity from the velocity pressure measured with inclined tube manometer.
- Estimate the method factor by dividing the average velocity and the central velocity.

## Simulation Procedure

The following procedure is to be followed by the user in order to determine the method factor of a duct:

1. Start the Experiment by click on the button "Start Experiment".
